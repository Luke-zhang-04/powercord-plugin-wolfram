# Wolfram

A Powercord plugin which adds a command to calculate things using Wolfram's API.

This plugin is an improved fork of the [original Wolfram plugin](https://github.com/ItsSyfe/Wolfram/)

## Usage

As this plugin implements Wolfram's API through [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/), an API key registered through their website is needed.

This is simple to get! All you need to do is sign up for an account. Then register an app [here.](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/)

After you have acquired your AppID, head to your user settings and navigate to Wolfram's settings panel. Paste your AppID there, and try the plugin out, if it still errors, you might need to reload Discord.

**Usage**
For these examples, the command prefix will be `.`

-   Query wolfram: `.wolfram eval x+5=2`
-   Send the result: `.wolfram eval x+5=2 --send`
-   Keep the result: `.wolfram eval x+5=2 --private`
